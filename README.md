# Blinkit Power BI Dashboard Project

## Project Statement

### Context
Blinkit is a quick-commerce platform that delivers groceries and essentials within minutes. To operate effectively at this scale, efficient data management and visualization are critical for monitoring performance, identifying trends, and making data-driven decisions.

### Challenge
Managing large volumes of data related to orders, inventory, delivery times, customer feedback, and other metrics is complex. Without a centralized dashboard, decision-making becomes inefficient, which can negatively impact operational performance and customer satisfaction.

   - Orders (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Delivery time trends and bottlenecks
   - Inventory status and restocking requirements
   - Customer satisfaction ratings and feedback analysis
   - Revenue and profit margins
2. Enable real-time updates and interactive filtering capabilities
3. Provide actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and customer experience

### Target Audience
This dashboard is designed for:
- Business stakeholders who need performance summaries
- Operations managers who require granular data to optimize processes
- Data analysts and engineers seeking backend insights

### Key Features
- Interactive charts (bar, line, pie, etc.) for intuitive analysis
- Drill-down capabilities for in-depth exploration
- Filters by time, region, and product categories
- Export options for sharing reports across teams

### Expected Outcomes
- A user-friendly dashboard that supports data-driven decisions
- Improved operational visibility and efficiency
- A reusable framework for other quick-commerce businesses

### Why This Project?
This project demonstrates:
- Advanced Power BI visualization techniques
- Real-world data integration
- Problem-solving through analytics and technology
